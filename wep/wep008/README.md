# WEP008 - Decentralized WAMP Service Mesh

WAMP is an open standard WebSocket subprotocol that provides two application messaging patterns in one unified protocol: routed Remote Procedure Calls and Publish & Subscribe. This extension allows to federate WAMP routers of different operators to create a decentralized WAMP service mesh with trust anchors in Ethereum.
