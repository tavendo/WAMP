## Preface

This is *part 1* of the WAMP specification. It introduces the concepts and terminology, and describes the *mandatory* features and aspects of the protocol and its usage which together constitute the **WAMP Basic Profile**.

The information in this part is considered self-contained and sufficient for implementers of WAMP Basic Profile compliant and interoperable implementations.

For *optional* features and aspects of the protocol that are part of the **WAMP Advanced Profile**, please see
 [The Web Application Messaging Protocol, Part 2: Advanced Profile](advanced.md)


## Introduction

WAMP ("The Web Application Messaging Protocol") is a communication protocol that enables distributed application architectures, with application functionality spread across nodes and all application communication decoupled by messages routed via dedicated WAMP routers.

At its core, WAMP provides applications with **two asynchronous messaging patterns within one unified protocol**:

 * Publish & Subscribe
 * Remote Procedure Calls

*Remote Procedure Call (RPC)* is a messaging pattern involving peers of three roles: *Caller*, *Dealer* and *Callee*.
A *Callee* registers procedures with application code to call remotely from *Callers* under application defined, unique names ("Procedure URIs"). A *Dealer* performs the routing of calls and results between *Callers* and *Callees*.

*Publish & Subscribe (PubSub)* is a messaging pattern involving peers of three roles: *Publisher*, *Broker* and *Subscriber*.
A *Subscriber* subscribes to topics under application defined, unique names ("Topic URIs") to receive events published by *Publishers* to such topics. A *Broker* performs the routing of events from *Publishers* to *Subscribers*.


### Realms, Sessions and Transports

A *Realm* is a WAMP routing and administrative domain (optionally) protected by authentication and authorization.
A *Session* is a transient conversation between two *Peers* attached to a *Realm* and running over a *Transport*.

![Realms, Sessions and Transports scheme](figure/sessions2.png "Realms, Sessions and Transports overview")


A *Transport* connects two WAMP *Peers* and provides a channel over which WAMP messages for a WAMP *Session* can flow in both directions.

WAMP can run over different *transports*. A *Transport* suitable for WAMP must have the following characteristics:

 * message based
 * bidirectional
 * reliable
 * ordered

The default transport for WAMP is [WebSocket](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455), where WAMP is an [officially registered](http://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml) subprotocol. For other transports, please see the [Advanced Profile](advanced.md).

WAMP is currently defined for the following *serializations*:

 * JSON
 * MsgPack

When the transport allows for - as is the case with WebSocket - WAMP lets you combine the transport with any serialization.


### Peers and Roles

A WAMP *Session* connects two *Peers*, a *Client* and a *Router*. Each WAMP *Peer* can implement one or more roles.

A *Client* can implement any combination of the *Roles*:

 * *Callee*
 * *Caller*
 * *Publisher*
 * *Subscriber*

and a *Router* can implement either or both of the *Roles*:

 * *Dealer*
 * *Broker*

> This document describes WAMP as in client-to-router communication. Direct client-to-client communication is not supported by WAMP. Router-to-router communication MAY be defined by a specific router implementation.
>

**Symmetric Messaging**

It is important to note that though the establishment of a *Transport* might have a inherent asymmetry (like a TCP client establishing a WebSocket connection to a server), and *Clients* establish WAMP sessions by attaching to *Realms* on *Routers*, WAMP itself is designed to be fully symmetric for application components.

After the transport and a session have been established, any application component may act as *Caller*, *Callee*, *Publisher* and *Subscriber* at the same time. And *Routers* provide the fabric on top of which WAMP runs a symmetric application messaging service.

**Remote Procedure Call Roles**

The Remote Procedure Call messaging pattern involves peers of three different roles:

* *Callee (Client)*
* *Caller (Client)*
* *Dealer (Router)*

A *Caller* issues calls to remote procedures by providing the procedure URI and any arguments for the call.
The *Callee* will execute the procedure using the supplied arguments to the call and return the result of the call to the *Caller*.

*Callees* register procedures they provide with *Dealers*. *Callers* initiate procedure calls first to *Dealers*. *Dealers* route calls incoming from *Callers* to *Callees* implementing the procedure called, and route call results back from *Callees* to *Callers*.

The *Caller* and *Callee* will usually run application code, while the *Dealer* works as a generic router for remote procedure calls decoupling *Callers* and *Callees*.

**Publish & Subscribe Roles**

The Publish & Subscribe messaging pattern involves peers of three different roles:

* *Subscriber (Client)*
* *Publisher (Client)*
* *Broker (Router)*

A *Publishers* publishes events to topics by providing the topic URI and any payload for the event. *Subscribers* of the topic will receive the event together with the event payload.

*Subscribers* subscribe to topics they are interested in with *Brokers*. *Publishers* initiate publication first at *Brokers*. *Brokers* route events incoming from *Publishers* to *Subscribers* that are subscribed to respective topics.

The *Publisher* and *Subscriber* will usually run application code, while the *Broker* works as a generic router for events decoupling *Publishers* from *Subscribers*.

> **Peers with multiple Roles**
>
> Note that *Peers* might implement more than one role: e.g. a *Peer* might act as *Caller*, *Publisher* and *Subscriber* at the same time. Another *Peer* might act as both a *Broker* and a *Dealer*.
>

> **Routers with embedded Clients**
>
> While a *Router* may only act as a *Broker* and a *Dealer*, the program or system process the *Router* runs in may additionally implement a *Client* with e.g. a *Callee* role. Here the *Router* may establish an internal connection with the  embedded *Client* via WAMP direct calls and callbacks, so that no actual message serialization is necessary (see figure below).
>

### Application Code

WAMP is designed for application code to run inside *Clients*, i.e. *Peers* of the roles *Callee*, *Caller*, *Publisher* and *Subscriber*.

*Routers*, i.e. *Peers* of the roles *Brokers* and *Dealers* are responsible for **generic call and event routing** and do not run application code.

This allows to transparently exchange *Broker* and *Dealer* implementations without affecting the application and to distribute and deploy application components flexibly:

![WAMP Client-Server Architecture](figure/appcode.png "Application Code")

> Note that a **program** that implements e.g. the *Dealer* role might at the same time implement e.g. a built-in *Callee*. It is the *Dealer* and *Broker* that are generic, not the program.
>

### Router Implementation Specifics

Specific WAMP *Broker* and *Dealer* implementations might differ in aspects such as:

* support for WAMP Advanced Profile
* router networks (clustering and federation)
* authentication and authorization schemes
* message persistence
* management and monitoring

The definition and documentation of implementation specific *Router* features like above is outside the scope of this document.


## Building Blocks

WAMP is defined with respect to the following building blocks

   1. Identifier
   2. Serialization
   3. Transport

For each building block, WAMP only assumes a defined set of requirements, which allows to run WAMP variants with different concrete bindings.


### Identifiers

#### URIs

WAMP needs to identify the following *persistent* resources:

  1. Topics
  2. Procedures
  3. Errors

These are identified in WAMP using *Uniform Resource Identifiers* (URIs) that MUST be Unicode strings. 

> Note: When using JSON as WAMP serialization format, URIs (as other strings) are transmitted in UTF-8 encoding.

*Examples*

   	com.myapp.mytopic1
   	com.myapp.myprocedure1
   	com.myapp.myerror1

The URIs are understood to form a single, global, hierarchical namespace for WAMP.

> The namespace is unified for topics, procedures and errors - these different resource types do NOT have separate namespaces.
>

To avoid resource naming conflicts, we follow the package naming convention from Java where URIs SHOULD begin with (reversed) domain names owned by the organization defining the URI.

**Relaxed/Loose URIs**

URI components (the parts between two `.`s, the head part up to the first `.`, the tail part after the last `.`) MUST NOT contain a `.`, `#` or whitespace characters and MUST NOT be empty (zero-length strings).

> We cannot allow `.` in component strings, since `.` is used to separate components, and WAMP associates semantics with resource hierarchies such as in pattern-based subscriptions. We cannot allow empty (zero-length) strings as components, since this has special meaning to denote wildcard components with pattern-based subscriptions and registrations. More about pattern-based subscriptions can be found in the specification for the [*Advanced Profile*](advanced.md). We cannot allow `#`, which is reserved for internal use by *Dealers* and *Brokers*.

As an example, the following regular expression could be used in Python to check URIs according to above rules:

```python
## loose URI check disallowing empty URI components
pattern = re.compile(r"^([^\s\.#]+\.)*([^\s\.#]+)$")
```

When empty URI components are allowed (which *only* is the case in specific messages from the [*Advanced Profile*](advanced.md)), you can use this regular expression:

```python
## loose URI check allowing empty URI components
pattern = re.compile(r"^(([^\s\.#]+\.)|\.)*([^\s\.#]+)?$")
```

**Strict URIs**

While above rules are *mandatory*, WAMP *recommends* following a stricter URI rule: URI components SHOULD only contain letters, digits and `_`.

As an example, the following regular expression could be used in Python to check URIs according to above rules:

```python
## strict URI check disallowing empty URI components
pattern = re.compile(r"^([0-9a-z_]+\.)*([0-9a-z_]+)$")
```

When empty URI components are allowed (which *only* is the case in specific messages from the [*Advanced Profile*](advanced.md)), you can use this regular expression:

```python
## strict URI check allowing empty URI components
pattern = re.compile(r"^(([0-9a-z_]+\.)|\.)*([0-9a-z_]+)?$")
```

> Following the suggested regular expression will make URI components valid identifiers in most languages (modulo URIs starting with a digit and language keywords) and the use of lower-case only will make those identifiers unique in languages that have case-insensitive identifiers. Following this suggestion can allow implementations to map topics, procedures and errors to the language environment in a completely transparent way.

**Reserved URIs**

Further, application URIs MUST NOT use `wamp` as a first URI component, since this is reserved for URIs predefined with the WAMP protocol itself.

*Examples*

	wamp.error.not_authorized
   	wamp.error.procedure_already_exists


#### IDs

WAMP needs to identify the following *ephemeral* entities each in the scope noted:

1. Sessions *(global scope)*
2. Publications *(global scope)*
3. Subscriptions *(router scope)*
4. Registrations *(router scope)*
5. Requests *(session scope)*

These are identified in WAMP using IDs that are integers between (inclusive) **0** and **2^53** (9007199254740992):

* IDs in the *global scope* MUST be drawn *randomly* from a *uniform distribution* over the complete range [0, 2^53]
* IDs in the *router scope* can be chosen freely by the specific router implementation
* IDs in the *session scope* SHOULD be incremented by 1 beginning with 1 (for each direction - *Client-to-Router* and *Router-to-Client*)

> The reason to choose the specific upper bound is that 2^53 is the largest integer such that this integer and *all* (positive) smaller integers can be represented exactly in IEEE-754 doubles. Some languages (e.g. JavaScript) use doubles as their sole number type. Most languages do have signed and unsigned 64-bit integer types which both can hold any value from the specified range.
>

For reference, the following is a complete list of usage of IDs in the three categories for all WAMP [Messages](#messages) (see subsequent chapters).

**Global Scope IDs**

* `WELCOME.Session`
* `PUBLISHED.Publication`
* `EVENT.Publication`


**Router Scope IDs**

* `EVENT.Subscription`
* `SUBSCRIBED.Subscription`
* `REGISTERED.Registration`
* `UNSUBSCRIBE.Subscription`
* `UNREGISTER.Registration`
* `INVOCATION.Registration`


**Session Scope IDs**

* `ERROR.Request`
* `PUBLISH.Request`
* `PUBLISHED.Request`
* `SUBSCRIBE.Request`
* `SUBSCRIBED.Request`
* `UNSUBSCRIBE.Request`
* `UNSUBSCRIBED.Request`
* `CALL.Request`
* `CANCEL.Request`
* `RESULT.Request`
* `REGISTER.Request`
* `REGISTERED.Request`
* `UNREGISTER.Request`
* `UNREGISTERED.Request`
* `INVOCATION.Request`
* `INTERRUPT.Request`
* `YIELD.Request`


### Serializations

WAMP is a message based protocol that requires serialization of messages to octet sequences to be sent out on the wire.

A message *serialization* format is assumed that (at least) provides the following types:

  * `integer` (non-negative)
  * `string` (UTF-8 encoded Unicode)
  * `bool`
  * `list`
  * `dict` (with string keys)

> WAMP *itself* only uses the above types, e.g. it does not use the JSON data types `number` (non-integer) and `null`. The *application payloads* transmitted by WAMP (e.g. in call arguments or event payloads) may use other types a concrete serialization format supports.
>

WAMP defines two bindings for message *serialization*:

 1. [JSON](http://www.json.org/)
 2. [MsgPack](http://msgpack.org/)

Other bindings for *serialization* may be defined in future WAMP versions.

#### JSON

With JSON serialization, each WAMP message is serialized according to the JSON specification as described in [RFC4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt).

Further, binary data follows a convention for conversion to JSON strings. For details, see the Appendix.

#### MsgPack

With MsgPack serialization, each WAMP message is serialized according to the MsgPack specification as described in [here](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md).

The version 5 of MsgPack MUST BE used, since this version is able to differentiate between strings and binary values.


### Transports

WAMP assumes a *transport* with the following characteristics:

  1. message-based
  2. reliable
  3. ordered
  4. bidirectional (full-duplex)


#### WebSocket Transport

The default transport binding for WAMP is [WebSocket](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).

With WebSocket in **unbatched mode**, WAMP messages are transmitted as WebSocket messages: each WAMP message is transmitted as a separate WebSocket message (not WebSocket frame).

The WAMP protocol MUST BE negotiated during the WebSocket opening handshake between *Peers* using the WebSocket subprotocol negotiation mechanism.

WAMP uses the following WebSocket subprotocol identifiers for unbatched modes:

 * `wamp.2.json`
 * `wamp.2.msgpack`

With `wamp.2.json`, *all* WebSocket messages MUST BE of type **text** (UTF8 encoded payload) and use the JSON message serialization.

With `wamp.2.msgpack`, *all* WebSocket messages MUST BE of type **binary** and use the MsgPack message serialization.

#### Transport and Session Lifetime

The following sequence diagram shows the relation between the *lifetime* of a WebSocket transport and WAMP sessions:

![alt text](figure/sessions4.png "Transport and Session Lifetime")


## Messages

All WAMP messages are of the same structure, a `list` with a first element `MessageType` followed by one or more message type specific elements:

    [MessageType|integer, ... one or more message type specific elements ...]

The notation `Element|type` denotes a message element named `Element` of type `type`, where `type` is one of

 * `id`: an integer ID as defined in [section IDs](#ids)
 * `uri`: a string URI as defined in [section URIs](#uris)

or 

 * `integer`: a non-negative integer
 * `string`: a Unicode string, including the empty string
 * `bool`: a boolean value (`true` or `false`) - integers MUST NOT be used instead of boolean values
 * `dict`: a dictionary (map) where keys MUST be strings, keys MUST be unique and serialization order is undefined (left to the serializer being used)
 * `list`: a list (array) where items can be again any of this enumeration

*Example*

A `SUBSCRIBE` message has the following format

	[SUBSCRIBE, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri]

Here is an example message conforming to above format

	[32, 713845233, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1"]


> **Extensibility**
> Some WAMP messages contain `Options|dict` or `Details|dict` elements. This allows for future extensibility and implementations that only provide subsets of functionality by ignoring unimplemented attributes. Keys in `Options` and `Details` MUST be of type `string` and MUST match the regular expression `[a-z][a-z0-9_]{2,}` for WAMP *predefined* keys. Implementations MAY use implementation-specific keys which MUST match the regular expression `_[a-z0-9_]{3,}`. Attributes unknown to an implementation MUST be ignored.
>
> **Polymorphism**
> For a given `MessageType` *and* number of message elements the expected types are uniquely defined. Hence there are no polymorphic messages in WAMP. This leads to a message parsing and validation control flow that is efficient, simple to implement and simple to code for rigorous message format checking.
>
> **Structure**
> The *application* payload (that is call arguments, call results, event payload etc) is always at the end of the message element list. The rationale is: *Brokers* and *Dealers* have no need to inspect (parse) the application payload. Their business is call/event routing. Having the application payload at the end of the list allows *Brokers* and *Dealers* to skip parsing it altogether. This can improve efficiency and performance.

### Message Definitions

WAMP defines the following messages which are explained in detail in the following sections.

The messages concerning the WAMP session itself are mandatory for all *Peers*, i.e. a *Client* MUST implement `HELLO`, `ABORT` and `GOODBYE`, while a *Router* MUST implement `WELCOME`, `ABORT` and `GOODBYE`.

All other messages are mandatory *per role*, i.e. in an implementation which only provides a *Client* with the role of *Publisher* MUST additionally implement sending `PUBLISH` and receiving `PUBLISHED` and `ERROR` messages.


#### HELLO

Sent by a *Client* to initiate opening of a WAMP session to a *Router* attaching to a *Realm*.

    [HELLO, Realm|uri, Details|dict]

#### WELCOME

Sent by a *Router* to accept a *Client*. The WAMP session is now open.

    [WELCOME, Session|id, Details|dict, Extra|dict]

#### ABORT

Sent by a *Peer* to abort the opening of a WAMP session. No response is expected.

    [ABORT, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

#### GOODBYE

Sent by a *Peer* to close a previously opened WAMP session. Must be echo'ed by the receiving *Peer*.

    [GOODBYE, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

#### ERROR

Error reply sent by a *Peer* as an error response to different kinds of requests.

    [ERROR, REQUEST.Type|int, REQUEST.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

### Extension Messages

WAMP uses type codes from the core range [0, 255]. Implementations MAY define and use implementation specific messages with message type codes from the extension message range [256, 1023]. For example, a router MAY implement router-to-router communication by using extension messages.

### Empty Arguments and Keyword Arguments

Implementations SHOULD avoid sending empty `Arguments` lists.

E.g. a `CALL` message

    [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list]

where `Arguments == []` SHOULD be avoided, and instead

    [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri]

SHOULD be sent.

Implementations SHOULD avoid sending empty `ArgumentsKw` dicts.

E.g. a `CALL` message

    [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list, ArgumentsKw|dict]

where `ArgumentsKw == {}` SHOULD be avoid, and instead

    [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list]

SHOULD be sent when `Arguments` is non-empty and

    [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri]

SHOULD be sent when `Arguments` is empty.


## Sessions

The message flow between *Clients* and *Routers* for opening and closing WAMP sessions involves the following messages:

1. `HELLO`
2. `WELCOME`
3. `ABORT`
4. `GOODBYE`

### Session Establishment

#### HELLO

After the underlying transport has been established, opening of a WAMP session is initiated by the *Client* sending a `HELLO` message to the *Router*

    [HELLO, Realm|uri, Details|dict]

 * `Realm` is a string identifying the realm this session should attach to
 * `Details` is a dictionary that allows to provide additional opening information (see below).

The `HELLO` message MUST be the very first message sent by the *Client* after the transport has been established.

In the WAMP Basic Profile without session authentication the *Router* will reply with a `WELCOME` or `ABORT` message.

![WAMP Session establishment picture](figure/hello.png "WAMP Session success")

A WAMP session starts its lifetime when the *Router* has sent a `WELCOME` message to the *Client*, and ends when the underlying transport closes or when the session is closed explicitly by either peer sending the `GOODBYE` message (see below).

It is a protocol error to receive a second `HELLO` message during the lifetime of the session and the *Peer* must fail the session if that happens.

##### Client: Role and Feature Announcement

WAMP uses *Role & Feature announcement* instead of *protocol versioning* to allow

 * implementations only supporting subsets of functionality
 * future extensibility

A *Client* must announce the **roles** it supports via `Hello.Details.roles|dict`, with a key mapping to a `Hello.Details.roles.<role>|dict` where `<role>` can be:

 * `publisher`
 * `subscriber`
 * `caller`
 * `callee`

A *Client* can support any combination of above roles but must support at least one role.

The `<role>|dict` is a dictionary describing **features** supported by the peer for that role.

With WAMP Basic Profile implementations, the *Features* dictionaries per *Role* will be empty. With WAMP Advanced Profile implementations, the *Features* dictionaries will list the (advanced) features supported per *Role*.

*Example: A Client that implements the Publisher and Subscriber roles of the WAMP Basic Profile.*

	[1, "somerealm", {
       "roles": {
          "publisher": {},
          "subscriber": {}
       }
   	}]


#### WELCOME

A *Router* completes the opening of a WAMP session by sending a `WELCOME` reply message to the *Client*.

   	[WELCOME, Session|id, Details|dict, Extra|dict]

 * `Session` MUST be a randomly generated ID specific to the WAMP session. This applies for the lifetime of the session.
 * `Details` is a dictionary that allows to provide additional information regarding the open session (see below).
 * `Extra` is a dictionary which allows applications to pass additional (arbitrary) informations to a peer. Its not mandatory and if its not present, client implementations should treat that case, like an empty dictionary were present. This dictionary can be used for application logic to e.g pass a session token to a peer.

In the WAMP Basic Profile without session authentication, a `WELCOME` message is the first message sent by the *Router*, directly in response to a `HELLO` message received from the *Client*.

> Note. The behavior if a requested `Realm` does not presently exist is router-specific. A router may e.g. automatically create the realm, or deny the establishment of the session with a `ABORT` reply message.
>

##### Router: Role and Feature Announcement

Similar to `HELLO` announcing *Roles* and *Features* supported by a *Client* to a *Router*, a *Router* announces its support to the *Client*  in an initial `WELCOME` message.

A *Router* must announce the **roles** it supports via `Welcome.Details.roles|dict`, with a key mapping to a `Welcome.Details.roles.<role>|dict` where `<role>` can be:

 * `broker`
 * `dealer`

A *Router* must support at least one role, and may support both roles.

The `<role>|dict` is a dictionary describing **features** supported by the peer for that role. With WAMP Basic Profile implementations, this will be empty.

*Example: A Router implementing the Broker role of the WAMP Basic Profile.*

   	[2, 9129137332, {
       "roles": {
          "broker": {}
       }
   	}]


#### ABORT

Both the *Router* and the *Client* may abort the opening of a WAMP session

![WAMP Session aborting picture](figure/hello_denied.png "WAMP Session denied")

by sending an `ABORT` message.

   	[ABORT, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

 * `Reason` MUST be an URI.
 * `Details` is a dictionary that allows to provide additional, optional closing information (see below).

No response to an `ABORT` message is expected.

*Example*

    [3, {"message": "The realm does not exist."}, "wamp.error.no_such_realm"]


### Session Closing

A WAMP session starts its lifetime with the *Router* sending a `WELCOME` message to the *Client* and ends when the underlying transport disappears or when the WAMP session is closed explicitly by a `GOODBYE` message sent by one *Peer* and a `GOODBYE` message sent from the other *Peer* in response.

![WAMP Session denied picture](figure/goodbye.png "WAMP Session denied")


   	[GOODBYE, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

 * `Reason` MUST be an URI.
 * `Details` is a dictionary that allows to provide additional, optional closing information (see below).

*Example*. One *Peer* initiates closing

    [6, {"message": "The host is shutting down now."}, "wamp.error.system_shutdown"]

and the other peer replies

	[6, {}, "wamp.error.goodbye_and_out"]


*Example*. One *Peer* initiates closing

    [6, {}, "wamp.error.close_realm"]

and the other peer replies

	[6, {}, "wamp.error.goodbye_and_out"]


#### Difference between ABORT and GOODBYE

The differences between `ABORT` and `GOODBYE` messages are:

1. `ABORT` gets sent only *before* a *Session* is established, while `GOODBYE` is sent only *after* a *Session* is already established.
2. `ABORT` is never replied by a *Peer*, whereas `GOODBYE` must be replied by the receiving *Peer*

> Though `ABORT` and `GOODBYE` are structurally identical, using different message types serves to reduce overloaded meaning of messages and simplify message handling code.
> 

## Publish and Subscribe

All of the following features for Publish & Subscribe are mandatory for WAMP Basic Profile implementations supporting the respective roles.


### Subscribing and Unsubscribing

The message flow between *Clients* implementing the role of *Subscriber* and *Routers* implementing the role of *Broker* for subscribing and unsubscribing involves the following messages:

 1. `SUBSCRIBE`
 2. `SUBSCRIBED`
 3. `UNSUBSCRIBE`
 4. `UNSUBSCRIBED`
 5. `ERROR`

![WAMP Publishing and Subscribing picture](figure/pubsub_subscribe1.png "PubSub: Subscribing and Unsubscribing")

A *Subscriber* may subscribe to zero, one or more topics, and a *Publisher* publishes to topics without knowledge of subscribers.

Upon subscribing to a topic via the `SUBSCRIBE` message, a *Subscriber* will receive any future events published to the respective topic by *Publishers*, and will receive those events asynchronously.

A subscription lasts for the duration of a session, unless a *Subscriber* opts out from a previously established subscription via the `UNSUBSCRIBE` message.

A *Subscriber* may have more than one event handler attached to the same subscription. This can be implemented in different ways:

* a *Subscriber* can recognize itself that it is already subscribed and just attach another handler to the subscription for incoming events
* or it can send a new `SUBSCRIBE` message to broker (as it would be first) and upon receiving a `SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id` it already knows about, attach the handler to the existing subscription

#### SUBSCRIBE

A *Subscriber* communicates its interest in a topic to a *Broker* by sending a `SUBSCRIBE` message:

    [SUBSCRIBE, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri]

where

 * `Request` is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the *Subscriber* and used to correlate the *Broker's* response with the request.
 * `Options` is a dictionary that allows to provide additional subscription request details in a extensible way. This is described further below.
 * `Topic` is the topic the *Subscriber* wants to subscribe to.

*Example*

	[32, 713845233, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1"]

A *Broker*, receiving a `SUBSCRIBE` message, can fullfil or reject the subscription, so it answers with `SUBSCRIBED` or `ERROR` messages.

#### SUBSCRIBED

If the *Broker* is able to fulfill and allow the subscription, it answers by sending a `SUBSCRIBED` message to the *Subscriber*

    [SUBSCRIBED, SUBSCRIBE.Request|id, Subscription|id]

where

 * `SUBSCRIBE.Request` is the ID from the original request.
 * `Subscription` is an ID chosen by the *Broker* for the subscription.

*Example*

	[33, 713845233, 5512315355]

> Note. The `Subscription` ID chosen by the broker need not be unique to the subscription of a single *Subscriber*, but may be assigned to the `Topic`, or the combination of the `Topic` and some or all `Options`, such as the topic pattern matching method to be used. Then this ID may be sent to all *Subscribers* for the `Topic` or `Topic` /  `Options` combination. This allows the *Broker* to serialize an event to be delivered only once for all actual receivers of the event.

> In case of receiving a `SUBSCRIBE` message from the same *Subscriber* and to already subscribed topic, *Broker* should answer with `SUBSCRIBED` message, containing the existing `Subscription|id`.

#### Subscription ERROR

When the request for subscription cannot be fulfilled by the *Broker*, the *Broker* sends back an `ERROR` message to the *Subscriber*

    [ERROR, SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

where

 * `SUBSCRIBE.Request` is the ID from the original request.
 * `Error` is an URI that gives the error of why the request could not be fulfilled.

*Example*

   	[8, 32, 713845233, {}, "wamp.error.not_authorized"]


#### UNSUBSCRIBE

When a *Subscriber* is no longer interested in receiving events for a subscription it sends an `UNSUBSCRIBE` message

    [UNSUBSCRIBE, Request|id, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id]

where

 * `Request` is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the *Subscriber* and used to correlate the *Broker's* response with the request.
 * `SUBSCRIBED.Subscription` is the ID for the subscription to unsubscribe from, originally handed out by the *Broker* to the *Subscriber*.

*Example*

   	[34, 85346237, 5512315355]

#### UNSUBSCRIBED

Upon successful unsubscription, the *Broker* sends an `UNSUBSCRIBED` message to the *Subscriber*

    [UNSUBSCRIBED, UNSUBSCRIBE.Request|id]

where

 * `UNSUBSCRIBE.Request` is the ID from the original request.

*Example*

   	[35, 85346237]


#### Unsubscribe ERROR

When the request fails, the *Broker* sends an `ERROR`

    [ERROR, UNSUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

where

 * `UNSUBSCRIBE.Request` is the ID from the original request.
 * `Error` is an URI that gives the error of why the request could not be fulfilled.

*Example*

   	[8, 34, 85346237, {}, "wamp.error.no_such_subscription"]


### Publishing and Events

The message flow between *Publishers*, a *Broker* and *Subscribers* for publishing to topics and dispatching events involves the following messages:

 1. `PUBLISH`
 2. `PUBLISHED`
 3. `EVENT`
 4. `ERROR`

![WAMP Publishing event picture](figure/pubsub_publish1.png "PubSub: Publishing and Receiving")

#### PUBLISH

When a *Publisher* requests to publish an event to some topic, it sends a `PUBLISH` message to a *Broker*:

    [PUBLISH, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri]

or

   	[PUBLISH, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri, Arguments|list]

or

   	[PUBLISH, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri, Arguments|list, ArgumentsKw|dict]

where

 * `Request` is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the *Publisher* and used to correlate the *Broker's* response with the request.
 * `Options` is a dictionary that allows to provide additional publication request details in an extensible way. This is described further below.
 * `Topic` is the topic published to.
 * `Arguments` is a list of application-level event payload elements. The list may be of zero length.
 * `ArgumentsKw` is an optional dictionary containing application-level event payload, provided as keyword arguments. The dictionary may be empty.

If the *Broker* is able to fulfill and allowing the publication, the *Broker* will send the event to all current *Subscribers* of the topic of the published event.

By default, publications are unacknowledged, and the *Broker* will not respond, whether the publication was successful indeed or not. This behavior can be changed with the option `PUBLISH.Options.acknowledge|bool` (see below).

*Example*

    [16, 239714735, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1"]

*Example*

    [16, 239714735, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1", ["Hello, world!"]]

*Example*

    [16, 239714735, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1", [], {"color": "orange", "sizes": [23, 42, 7]}]


#### PUBLISHED

If the *Broker* is able to fulfill and allowing the publication, and `PUBLISH.Options.acknowledge == true`, the *Broker* replies by sending a `PUBLISHED` message to the *Publisher*:

    [PUBLISHED, PUBLISH.Request|id, Publication|id]

where

 * `PUBLISH.Request` is the ID from the original publication request.
 * `Publication` is a ID chosen by the Broker for the publication.


*Example*

    [17, 239714735, 4429313566]


#### Publish ERROR

When the request for publication cannot be fulfilled by the *Broker*, and `PUBLISH.Options.acknowledge == true`, the *Broker* sends back an `ERROR` message to the *Publisher*

    [ERROR, PUBLISH, PUBLISH.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

where

 * `PUBLISH.Request` is the ID from the original publication request.
 * `Error` is an URI that gives the error of why the request could not be fulfilled.

*Example*

    [8, 16, 239714735, {}, "wamp.error.not_authorized"]


#### EVENT

When a publication is successful and a *Broker* dispatches the event, it determines a list of receivers for the event based on *Subscribers* for the topic published to and, possibly, other information in the event.

Note that the *Publisher* of an event will never receive the published event even if the *Publisher* is also a *Subscriber* of the topic published to.

> WAMP Advanced Profile provides options for more detailed control over publication.
>

When a *Subscriber* is deemed to be a receiver, the *Broker* sends the *Subscriber* an `EVENT` message:

    [EVENT, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id, PUBLISHED.Publication|id, Details|dict]

or

    [EVENT, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id, PUBLISHED.Publication|id, Details|dict, PUBLISH.Arguments|list]

or

    [EVENT, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id, PUBLISHED.Publication|id, Details|dict, PUBLISH.Arguments|list, PUBLISH.ArgumentKw|dict]

where

 * `SUBSCRIBED.Subscription` is the ID for the subscription under which the *Subscriber* receives the event - the ID for the subscription originally handed out by the *Broker* to the *Subscriber*.
 * `PUBLISHED.Publication` is the ID of the publication of the published event.
 * `Details` is a dictionary that allows the *Broker* to provide additional event details in a extensible way. This is described further below.
 * `PUBLISH.Arguments` is the application-level event payload that was provided with the original publication request.
 * `PUBLISH.ArgumentKw` is the application-level event payload that was provided with the original publication request.

*Example*

   	[36, 5512315355, 4429313566, {}]

*Example*

   	[36, 5512315355, 4429313566, {}, ["Hello, world!"]]

*Example*

   	[36, 5512315355, 4429313566, {}, [], {"color": "orange", "sizes": [23, 42, 7]}]


## Remote Procedure Calls

All of the following features for Remote Procedure Calls are mandatory for WAMP Basic Profile implementations supporting the respective roles.


### Registering and Unregistering

The message flow between *Callees* and a *Dealer* for registering and unregistering endpoints to be called over RPC involves the following messages:

 1. `REGISTER`
 2. `REGISTERED`
 4. `UNREGISTER`
 5. `UNREGISTERED`
 6. `ERROR`

![WAMP RPC registering picture](figure/rpc_register1.png "RPC: Registering and Unregistering")

#### REGISTER

A *Callee* announces the availability of an endpoint implementing a procedure with a *Dealer* by sending a `REGISTER` message:

    [REGISTER, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri]

where

 * `Request` is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the *Callee* and used to correlate the *Dealer's* response with the request.
 * `Options` is a dictionary that allows to provide additional registration request details in a extensible way. This is described further below.
 * `Procedure`is the procedure the *Callee* wants to register

*Example*

   	[64, 25349185, {}, "com.myapp.myprocedure1"]

#### REGISTERED

If the *Dealer* is able to fulfill and allowing the registration, it answers by sending a `REGISTERED` message to the `Callee`:

   	[REGISTERED, REGISTER.Request|id, Registration|id]

where

 * `REGISTER.Request` is the ID from the original request.
 *  `Registration` is an ID chosen by the *Dealer* for the registration.

*Example*

   	[65, 25349185, 2103333224]

#### Register ERROR

When the request for registration cannot be fulfilled by the *Dealer*, the *Dealer* sends back an `ERROR` message to the *Callee*:

    [ERROR, REGISTER, REGISTER.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

 * `REGISTER.Request` is the ID from the original request.
 * `Error` is an URI that gives the error of why the request could not be fulfilled.

*Example*

   	[8, 64, 25349185, {}, "wamp.error.procedure_already_exists"]

#### UNREGISTER

When a *Callee* is no longer willing to provide an implementation of the registered procedure, it sends an `UNREGISTER` message to the *Dealer*:

    [UNREGISTER, Request|id, REGISTERED.Registration|id]

where

 * `Request` is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the *Callee* and used to correlate the *Dealer's* response with the request.
 * `REGISTERED.Registration` is the ID for the registration to revoke, originally handed out by the *Dealer* to the *Callee*.

*Example*

   	[66, 788923562, 2103333224]

#### UNREGISTERED

Upon successful unregistration, the *Dealer* sends an `UNREGISTERED` message to the *Callee*:

    [UNREGISTERED, UNREGISTER.Request|id]

where

 * `UNREGISTER.Request` is the ID from the original request.

*Example*

	[67, 788923562]

#### Unregister ERROR

When the unregistration request fails, the *Dealer* sends an `ERROR` message:

    [ERROR, UNREGISTER, UNREGISTER.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

where

 * `UNREGISTER.Request` is the ID from the original request.
 * `Error` is an URI that gives the error of why the request could not be fulfilled.

*Example*

   	[8, 66, 788923562, {}, "wamp.error.no_such_registration"]


### Calling and Invocations

The message flow between *Callers*, a *Dealer* and *Callees* for calling procedures and invoking endpoints involves the following messages:

 1. `CALL`
 2. `RESULT`
 3. `INVOCATION`
 4. `YIELD`
 5. `ERROR`

![WAMP RPC Calling picture](figure/rpc_call1.png "RPC: Calling")

The execution of remote procedure calls is asynchronous, and there may be more than one call outstanding. A call is called outstanding (from the point of view of the *Caller*), when a (final) result or error has not yet been received by the *Caller*.

### CALL

When a *Caller* wishes to call a remote procedure, it sends a `CALL` message to a *Dealer*:

    [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri]

or

    [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list]

or

    [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list, ArgumentsKw|dict]

where

 * `Request` is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the *Caller* and used to correlate the *Dealer's* response with the request.
 * `Options` is a dictionary that allows to provide additional call request details in an extensible way. This is described further below.
 * `Procedure` is the URI of the procedure to be called.
 * `Arguments` is a list of positional call arguments (each of arbitrary type). The list may be of zero length.
 * `ArgumentsKw` is a dictionary of keyword call arguments (each of arbitrary type). The dictionary may be empty.

*Example*

   	[48, 7814135, {}, "com.myapp.ping"]

*Example*

   	[48, 7814135, {}, "com.myapp.echo", ["Hello, world!"]]

*Example*

   	[48, 7814135, {}, "com.myapp.add2", [23, 7]]

*Example*

   	[48, 7814135, {}, "com.myapp.user.new", ["johnny"], {"firstname": "John", "surname": "Doe"}]


#### INVOCATION

If the *Dealer* is able to fulfill (mediate) the call and it allows the call, it sends a `INVOCATION` message to the respective *Callee* implementing the procedure:

    [INVOCATION, Request|id, REGISTERED.Registration|id, Details|dict]

or

    [INVOCATION, Request|id, REGISTERED.Registration|id, Details|dict, CALL.Arguments|list]

or

    [INVOCATION, Request|id, REGISTERED.Registration|id, Details|dict, CALL.Arguments|list, CALL.ArgumentsKw|dict]

where

 * `Request` is a random, ephemeral ID chosen by the *Dealer* and used to correlate the *Callee's* response with the request.
 * `REGISTERED.Registration` is the registration ID under which the procedure was registered at the *Dealer*.
 * `Details` is a dictionary that allows to provide additional invocation request details in an extensible way. This is described further below.
 * `CALL.Arguments` is the original list of positional call arguments as provided by the *Caller*.

*Example*

   	[68, 6131533, 9823529, {}, ["johnny"], {"firstname": "John", "surname": "Doe"}]


#### YIELD

If the *Callee* is able to successfully process and finish the execution of the call, it answers by sending a `YIELD` message to the *Dealer*:

    [YIELD, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict]

or

    [YIELD, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict, Arguments|list]

or

    [YIELD, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict, Arguments|list, ArgumentsKw|dict]

where

 * `INVOCATION.Request` is the ID from the original invocation request.
 * `Options`is a dictionary that allows to provide additional options.
 * `Arguments` is a list of positional result elements (each of arbitrary type). The list may be of zero length.
 * `ArgumentsKw` is a dictionary of keyword result elements (each of arbitrary type). The dictionary may be empty.


*Example*

   	[70, 6131533, {}]

*Example*

   	[70, 6131533, {}, ["Hello, world!"]]

*Example*

   	[70, 6131533, {}, [30]]

*Example*

   	[70, 6131533, {}, [], {"userid": 123, "karma": 10}]


#### RESULT

The *Dealer* will then send a `RESULT` message to the original *Caller*:

    [RESULT, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict]

or

    [RESULT, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, YIELD.Arguments|list]

or

    [RESULT, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, YIELD.Arguments|list, YIELD.ArgumentsKw|dict]

where

 * `CALL.Request` is the ID from the original call request.
 * `Details` is a dictionary of additional details.
 * `YIELD.Arguments` is the original list of positional result elements as returned by the *Callee*.
 * `YIELD.ArgumentsKw` is the original dictionary of keyword result elements as returned by the *Callee*.

*Example*

   	[50, 7814135, {}]

*Example*

   	[50, 7814135, {}, ["Hello, world!"]]

*Example*

   	[50, 7814135, {}, [30]]

*Example*

   	[50, 7814135, {}, [], {"userid": 123, "karma": 10}]


#### Invocation ERROR


If the *Callee* is unable to process or finish the execution of the call, or the application code implementing the procedure raises an exception or otherwise runs into an error, the *Callee* sends an `ERROR` message to the *Dealer*:

   	[ERROR, INVOCATION, INVOCATION.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

or

   	[ERROR, INVOCATION, INVOCATION.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri, Arguments|list]

or

   	[ERROR, INVOCATION, INVOCATION.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri, Arguments|list, ArgumentsKw|dict]

where

 * `INVOCATION.Request` is the ID from the original `INVOCATION` request previously sent by the *Dealer* to the *Callee*.
 * `Details` is a dictionary with additional error details.
 * `Error` is an URI that identifies the error of why the request could not be fulfilled.
 * `Arguments` is a list containing arbitrary, application defined, positional error information. This will be forwarded by the *Dealer* to the *Caller* that initiated the call.
 * `ArgumentsKw` is a dictionary containing arbitrary, application defined, keyword-based error information. This will be forwarded by the *Dealer* to the *Caller* that initiated the call.

*Example*

   	[8, 68, 6131533, {}, "com.myapp.error.object_write_protected", ["Object is write protected."], {"severity": 3}]


#### Call ERROR

The *Dealer* will then send a `ERROR` message to the original *Caller*:

   	[ERROR, CALL, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

or

   	[ERROR, CALL, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri, Arguments|list]

or

   	[ERROR, CALL, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri, Arguments|list, ArgumentsKw|dict]

where

 * `CALL.Request` is the ID from the original `CALL` request sent by the *Caller* to the *Dealer*.
 * `Details` is a dictionary with additional error details.
 * `Error` is an URI identifying the type of error as returned by the *Callee* to the *Dealer*.
 * `Arguments` is a list containing the original error payload list as returned by the *Callee* to the *Dealer*.
 * `ArgumentsKw` is a dictionary containing the original error payload dictionary as returned by the *Callee* to the *Dealer*

*Example*

   	[8, 48, 7814135, {}, "com.myapp.error.object_write_protected", ["Object is write protected."], {"severity": 3}]

If the original call already failed at the *Dealer* **before** the call would have been forwarded to any *Callee*, the *Dealer* will send an `ERROR` message to the *Caller*:

   	[ERROR, CALL, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

*Example*

   	[8, 48, 7814135, {}, "wamp.error.no_such_procedure"]



## Appendix

### Predefined URIs

WAMP predefines the following URIs in the *basic profile*.

#### Predefined Errors

**Interactions**

*Peer* provided an incorrect URI for any URI-based attribute of WAMP message, such as realm, topic or procedure

	wamp.error.invalid_uri

A *Dealer* could not perform a call, since no procedure is currently registered under the given URI.

	wamp.error.no_such_procedure

A procedure could not be registered, since a procedure with the given URI is already registered.

	wamp.error.procedure_already_exists

A *Dealer* could not perform an unregister, since the given registration is not active.

	wamp.error.no_such_registration

A *Broker* could not perform an unsubscribe, since the given subscription is not active.

	wamp.error.no_such_subscription

A call failed, since the given argument types or values are not acceptable to the called procedure - in which case the *Callee* may throw this error. Or a Router performing *payload validation* checked the payload (`args` / `kwargs`) of a call, call result, call error or publish, and the payload did not conform - in which case the *Router* may throw this error.

	wamp.error.invalid_argument

**Session Close**

The *Peer* is shutting down completely - used as a `GOODBYE` (or `ABORT`) reason.

	wamp.error.system_shutdown

The *Peer* want to leave the realm - used as a `GOODBYE` reason.

	wamp.error.close_realm

A *Peer* acknowledges ending of a session - used as a `GOODBYE` reply reason.

	wamp.error.goodbye_and_out

**Authorization**

A join, call, register, publish or subscribe failed, since the *Peer* is not authorized to perform the operation.

	wamp.error.not_authorized

A *Dealer* or *Broker* could not determine if the *Peer* is authorized to perform a join, call, register, publish or subscribe, since the authorization operation *itself* failed. E.g. a custom authorizer did run into an error.

	wamp.error.authorization_failed

*Peer* wanted to join a non-existing realm (and the *Router* did not allow to auto-create the realm).

	wamp.error.no_such_realm
	
A *Peer* was to be authenticated under a Role that does not (or no longer) exists on the Router. For example, the *Peer* was successfully authenticated, but the Role configured does not exists - hence there is some misconfiguration in the Router.

	wamp.error.no_such_role


### Ordering Guarantees

All WAMP implementations, in particular *Routers* MUST support the following ordering guarantees.

> WAMP Advanced Profile may provide applications options to relax ordering guarantees, in particular with distributed calls.
>

#### Publish & Subscribe Ordering

Regarding **Publish & Subscribe**, the ordering guarantees are as follows:

If *Subscriber A* is subscribed to both **Topic 1** and **Topic 2**, and *Publisher B* first publishes an **Event 1** to **Topic 1** and then an **Event 2** to **Topic 2**, then *Subscriber A* will first receive **Event 1** and then **Event 2**. This also holds if **Topic 1** and **Topic 2** are identical.

In other words, WAMP guarantees ordering of events between any given *pair* of *Publisher* and *Subscriber*.

Further, if *Subscriber A* subscribes to **Topic 1**, the `SUBSCRIBED` message will be sent by *Broker* to *Subscriber A* before any `EVENT` message for **Topic 1**.

> In general, `SUBSCRIBE` is asynchronous, and there is no guarantee of order of return for multiple `SUBSCRIBEs`. The first `SUBSCRIBE` might require the *Broker* to do a time-consuming lookup in some database, whereas the second might be permissible immediately.
>

#### Remote Procedure Call Ordering

Regarding **Remote Procedure Calls**, the ordering guarantees are as follows:

If *Callee A* has registered endpoints for both **Procedure 1** and **Procedure 2**, and *Caller B* first issues a **Call 1** to **Procedure 1** and then a **Call 2** to **Procedure 2**, and both calls are routed to *Callee A*, then *Callee A* will first receive an invocation corresponding to **Call 1** and then **Call 2**. This also holds if **Procedure 1** and **Procedure 2** are identical.

In other words, WAMP guarantees ordering of invocations between any given *pair* of *Caller* and *Callee*.

There are no guarantees on the order of call results and errors in relation to *different* calls, since the execution of calls upon different invocations of endpoints in *Callees* are running independently. A first call might require an expensive, long-running computation, whereas a second, subsequent call might finish immediately.

Further, if *Callee A* registers for **Procedure 1**, the `REGISTERED` message will be sent by *Dealer* to *Callee A* before any `INVOCATION` message for **Procedure 1**.

> In general, `REGISTER` is asynchronous, and there is no guarantee on order of return for multiple `REGISTERs`. The first `REGISTER` might require the *Dealer* to do a time-consuming lookup in some database, whereas the second might be permissible immediately.
>

### Security Model

The security model of WAMP *basic profile* is discussed shortly in the following. For extensions to this security model, please see the [Advanced Profile](advanced.md).


#### Transport Encryption and Integrity

WAMP transports may provide (optional) transport-level encryption and integrity verification. If so, encryption and integrity is point-to-point: between a *Client* and the *Router* it is connected to.

Transport-level encryption and integrity is solely at the transport-level and transparent to WAMP. WAMP itself deliberately does not specify any kind of transport-level encryption.

Implementations that offer TCP based transport such as WAMP-over-WebSocket or WAMP-over-RawSocket (see [Advanced Profile](advanced.md)) **SHOULD implement [Transport Layer Security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)**.

**WAMP deployments are encouraged to stick to a TLS-only policy with the TLS code and setup being hardened.**  

Further, when a *Client* connects to a *Router* over a local-only transport such as Unix domain sockets, the integrity of the data transmitted is implicit (the OS kernel is trusted), and the privacy of the data transmitted can be assured using file system permissions (no one can tap a Unix domain socket without appropriate permissions or being root).

#### Router Authentication

To authenticate *Routers* to *Clients*, deployments MUST run TLS and *Clients* MUST verify the *Router* server certificate presented. WAMP itself does not provide mechanisms to authenticate a *Router* (only a *Client*).

The verification of the *Router* server certificate can happen

1. against a certificate trust database that comes with the *Clients* operating system
2. against an issuing certificate/key hard-wired into the *Client*
3. by using new mechanisms like [DNSSEC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnssec)/[DANE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities)/[TLSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLSA_record#TLSA) 

Further, when a *Client* connects to a *Router* over a local-only transport such as Unix domain sockets, the file system permissions can be used to create implicit trust. E.g. if only the OS user under which the *Router* runs has the permission to create a Unix domain socket under a specific path, *Clients* connecting to that path can trust in the router authenticity.


#### Client Authentication

To authenticate a *Client* to a *Router*, the WAMP [Advanced Profile](advanced.md) specifies different mechanisms at the WAMP level. 

Further, when running over TLS, a *Router* may authenticate a *Client* already at the transport level by doing a *client certificate based authentication*.

These mechanisms and approaches are described in the WAMP Advanced Profile.


#### Routers are trusted

*Routers* (in the WAMP Basic Profile) are *trusted* by *Clients*.

In particular, *Routers* can read (and modify) any application payload transmitted in events, calls, call results and call errors (the `Arguments` or `ArgumentsKw` message fields).

Hence, *Routers* do not provide confidentiality with respect to application payload, and also do not provide authenticity or integrity of application payloads that could be verified by a receiving *Client*.

While *Routers* in principle do not need to read the application payloads to perform routing, there are two situations where they logically must do so:

1. automatic conversion between different serialization formats
2. validation of application payloads according to schemata (see the WAMP Advanced Profile)

Further, *Routers* are trusted to **actually perform** routing as specified. E.g. a *Client* that publishes an event has to trust a *Router* that the event is actually dispatched to all (eligible) *Subscribers* by the *Router*.

A rogue *Router* might deny normal routing operation without a *Client* taking notice.


### Binary conversion of JSON Strings

Binary data follows a convention for conversion to JSON strings.

A **byte array** is converted to a **JSON string** as follows:

1. convert the byte array to a Base64 encoded (host language) string
2. prepend the string with a `\0` character
3. serialize the string to a JSON string

*Example*

Consider the byte array (hex representation):

   	10e3ff9053075c526f5fc06d4fe37cdb

This will get converted to Base64

   	EOP/kFMHXFJvX8BtT+N82w==

prepended with `\0`

   	\x00EOP/kFMHXFJvX8BtT+N82w==

and serialized to a JSON string

   	"\\u0000EOP/kFMHXFJvX8BtT+N82w=="

A **JSON string** is deserialized to either a **string** or a **byte array** using the following procedure:

1. Unserialize a JSON string to a host language (Unicode) string
2. If the string starts with a `\0` character, interpret the rest (after the first character) as Base64 and decode to a byte array
3. Otherwise, return the Unicode string

Below are complete Python and JavaScript code examples for conversion between byte arrays and JSON strings.

#### Python

Here is a complete example in Python showing how byte arrays are converted to and from JSON:

```python
import os, base64, json, sys, binascii
PY3 = sys.version_info >= (3,)
if PY3:
   unicode = str

data_in = os.urandom(16)
print("In:   {}".format(binascii.hexlify(data_in)))

## encoding
encoded = json.dumps('\0' + base64.b64encode(data_in).decode('ascii'))

print("JSON: {}".format(encoded))

## decoding
decoded = json.loads(encoded)
if type(decoded) == unicode:
   if decoded[0] == '\0':
      data_out = base64.b64decode(decoded[1:])
   else:
      data_out = decoded

print("Out:  {}".format(binascii.hexlify(data_out)))

assert(data_out == data_in)
```

#### JavaScript

Here is a complete example in JavaScript showing how byte arrays are converted to and from JSON:

```javascript
var data_in = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(16));

// initialize test data
for (var i = 0; i < data_in.length; ++i) {
   data_in[i] = i;
}
console.log(data_in);

// convert byte array to raw string
var raw_out = '';
for (var i = 0; i < data_in.length; ++i) {
   raw_out += String.fromCharCode(data_in[i]);
}

// base64 encode raw string, prepend with \0 and serialize to JSON
var encoded = JSON.stringify("\0" + window.btoa(raw_out));
console.log(encoded); // "\u0000AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=="

// unserialize from JSON
var decoded = JSON.parse(encoded);

var data_out;
if (decoded.charCodeAt(0) === 0) {
   // strip first character and decode base64 to raw string
   var raw = window.atob(decoded.substring(1));

   // convert raw string to byte array
   var data_out = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(raw.length));
   for (var i = 0; i < raw.length; ++i) {
      data_out[i] = raw.charCodeAt(i);
   }
} else {
   data_out = decoded;
}

console.log(data_out);
```
