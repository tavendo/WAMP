## Message Definitions

WAMP defines the following messages that are explained in detail in the following sections.

The messages concerning the WAMP session itself are mandatory for all Peers, i.e. a Client MUST implement `HELLO`, `ABORT` and `GOODBYE`, while a Router MUST implement `WELCOME`, `ABORT` and `GOODBYE`.

All other messages are mandatory per role, i.e. in an implementation that only provides a Client with the role of Publisher MUST additionally implement sending `PUBLISH` and receiving `PUBLISHED` and `ERROR` messages.
