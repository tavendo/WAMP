## Peers and Roles

A WAMP Session connects two Peers, a Client and a Router. Each WAMP Peer MUST implement one role, and MAY implement more roles.

A Client MAY implement any combination of the Roles:

 * Callee
 * Caller
 * Publisher
 * Subscriber

and a Router MAY implement either or both of the Roles:

 * Dealer
 * Broker

> This document describes WAMP as in client-to-router communication. Direct client-to-client communication is not supported by WAMP. Router-to-router communication MAY be defined by a specific router implementation.

### Symmetric Messaging

It is important to note that though the establishment of a Transport might have a inherent asymmetry (like a TCP client establishing a WebSocket connection to a server), and Clients establish WAMP sessions by attaching to Realms on Routers, WAMP itself is designed to be fully symmetric for application components.

After the transport and a session have been established, any application component may act as Caller, Callee, Publisher and Subscriber at the same time. And Routers provide the fabric on top of which WAMP runs a symmetric application messaging service.


### Remote Procedure Call Roles

The Remote Procedure Call messaging pattern involves peers of three different roles:

* Callee (Client)
* Caller (Client)
* Dealer (Router)

A Caller issues calls to remote procedures by providing the procedure URI and any arguments for the call.
The Callee will execute the procedure using the supplied arguments to the call and return the result of the call to the Caller.

Callees register procedures they provide with Dealers. Callers initiate procedure calls first to Dealers. Dealers route calls incoming from Callers to Callees implementing the procedure called, and route call results back from Callees to Callers.

The Caller and Callee will usually run application code, while the Dealer works as a generic router for remote procedure calls decoupling Callers and Callees.


### Publish & Subscribe Roles

The Publish & Subscribe messaging pattern involves peers of three different roles:

* Subscriber (Client)
* Publisher (Client)
* Broker (Router)

A Publisher publishes events to topics by providing the topic URI and any payload for the event. Subscribers of the topic will receive the event together with the event payload.

Subscribers subscribe to topics they are interested in with Brokers. Publishers initiate publication first at Brokers. Brokers route events incoming from Publishers to Subscribers that are subscribed to respective topics.

The Publisher and Subscriber will usually run application code, while the Broker works as a generic router for events decoupling Publishers from Subscribers.


### Peers with multiple Roles

Note that Peers might implement more than one role: e.g. a Peer might act as Caller, Publisher and Subscriber at the same time. Another Peer might act as both a Broker and a Dealer.
