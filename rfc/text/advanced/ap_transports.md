### Alternative Transports

The only requirements that WAMP expects from a transport are: the transport must be message-based, bidirectional, reliable and ordered. This allows WAMP to run over different transports without any impact at the application layer.

Besides the WebSocket transport, the following WAMP transports are currently specified:

* [RawSocket Transport](#rawsocket)
* [Batched WebSocket Transport](#batchedwebsocket)
* [LongPoll Transport](#longpoll)
* [Multiplexed Transport](#multiplexed)

> Other transports such as HTTP 2.0 ("SPDY") or UDP might be defined in the future.
