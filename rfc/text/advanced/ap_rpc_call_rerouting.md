### Call Re-Routing

A _CALLEE_ might not be able to attend to a call. This may be due to a multitude of reasons including, but not limited to:

- _CALLEE_ is busy handling other requests and is not able to attend
- _CALLEE_ has dependency issues which prevent it from being able to fulfil the request
- In a HA environment, the _Callee_ knows that it is scheduled to be taken off the HA cluster and as such should not handle the request.

A _unavailable_ response allows for **automatic** reroute of a call by the _Dealer_ without the _CALLER_ ever having to know about it.

When such a situation occurs, the _Callee_ responds to a `INVOCATION` message with the error uri:

{align="left"}
wamp.error.unavailable

When the _Dealer_ receives the `wamp.error.unavailable` message in response to an `INVOCATION`, it will reroute the `CALL` to another _registration_ according to the rerouting rules of the `invocation_policy` of the `procedure`, as given below.

#### Rerouting Rules

The _Dealer_ MUST adhere to the `invocation policy` of the `procedure` when rerouting the `CALL`, while assuming that the `unavailable` registration virtually does not exist.

For different `invocation policy` the _Dealer_ MUST follow:

| Invocation Policy | Operation                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `single`          | Responds with a `wamp.error.no_available_callee` error message to the _CALLER_                                                      |
| `roundrobin`      | Picks the next `registration` from the _Registration Queue_ of the _Procedure_                                                      |
| `random`          | Picks another `registration` at random from the Registration Queue of the _Procedure_, as long as it is not the same `registration` |
| `first`           | Picks the `registration` which was registered after the _called_ registration was registered                                        |
| `last`            | Picks the `registration` which was registered right before the _called_ registration was registered                                 |

#### Failure Scenario

In case all available registrations of a _Procedure_ responds with a `wamp.error.unavailable` for a _CALL_, the _Dealer_ MUST respond with a `wamp.error.no_available_callee` to the _CALLER_

#### Feature Announcement

Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callees_ (`role := "callee"`) and _Dealers_ (`role := "dealer"`) via

HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.call_reroute|bool := true
