### Progressive Call Results

#### Feature Definition

A procedure implemented by a *Callee* and registered at a *Dealer* may produce progressive results. Progressive results can e.g. be used to return partial results for long-running operations, or to chunk the transmission of larger results sets.

The message flow for progressive results involves:

     ,------.           ,------.          ,------.
     |Caller|           |Dealer|          |Callee|
     `--+---'           `--+---'          `--+---'
        |       CALL       |                 |
        | ----------------->                 |
        |                  |                 |
        |                  |    INVOCATION   |
        |                  | ---------------->
        |                  |                 |
        |                  | YIELD (progress)|
        |                  | <----------------
        |                  |                 |
        | RESULT (progress)|                 |
        | <-----------------                 |
        |                  |                 |
        |                  | YIELD (progress)|
        |                  | <----------------
        |                  |                 |
        | RESULT (progress)|                 |
        | <-----------------                 |
        |                  |                 |
        |                  |                 |
        |       ...        |       ...       |
        |                  |                 |
        |                  |  YIELD or ERROR |
        |                  | <----------------
        |                  |                 |
        |  RESULT or ERROR |                 |
        | <-----------------                 |
     ,--+---.           ,--+---.          ,--+---.
     |Caller|           |Dealer|          |Callee|
     `------'           `------'          `------'


A *Caller* indicates its willingness to receive progressive results by setting

{align="left"}
        CALL.Options.receive_progress|bool := true

*Example.* Caller-to-Dealer `CALL`

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        48,
        77133,
        {
            "receive_progress": true
        },
        "com.myapp.compute_revenue",
        [2010, 2011, 2012]
    ]
```

If the *Callee* supports progressive calls, the *Dealer* will forward the *Caller's* willingness to receive progressive results by setting

{align="left"}
        INVOCATION.Details.receive_progress|bool := true

*Example.* Dealer-to-Callee `INVOCATION`

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        68,
        87683,
        324,
        {
            "receive_progress": true
        },
        [2010, 2011, 2012]
    ]
```

An endpoint implementing the procedure produces progressive results by sending `YIELD` messages to the *Dealer* with

{align="left"}
        YIELD.Options.progress|bool := true

*Example.* Callee-to-Dealer progressive `YIELDs`

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        70,
        87683,
        {
            "progress": true
        },
        ["Y2010", 120]
    ]
```

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        70,
        87683,
        {
            "progress": true
        },
        ["Y2011", 205]
    ]
```


Upon receiving an `YIELD` message from a *Callee* with `YIELD.Options.progress == true` (for a call that is still ongoing), the *Dealer* will **immediately** send a `RESULT` message to the original *Caller* with

{align="left"}
        RESULT.Details.progress|bool := true

*Example.* Dealer-to-Caller progressive `RESULTs`

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        50,
        77133,
        {
            "progress": true
        },
        ["Y2010", 120]
    ]
```

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        50,
        77133,
        {
            "progress": true
        },
        ["Y2011", 205]
    ]
```
...


An invocation MUST *always* end in either a *normal* `RESULT` or `ERROR` message being sent by the *Callee* and received by the *Dealer*.

*Example.* Callee-to-Dealer final `YIELD`

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        70,
        87683,
        {},
        ["Total", 490]
    ]
```

*Example.* Callee-to-Dealer final `ERROR`

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        4,
        87683,
        {},
        "com.myapp.invalid_revenue_year",
        [1830]
    ]
```

A call MUST *always* end in either a *normal* `RESULT` or `ERROR` message being sent by the *Dealer* and received by the *Caller*.

*Example.* Dealer-to-Caller final `RESULT`

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        50,
        77133,
        {},
        ["Total", 490]
    ]
```

*Example.* Dealer-to-Caller final `ERROR`

{align="left"}
```json
    [
        4,
        77133,
        {},
        "com.myapp.invalid_revenue_year",
        [1830]
    ]
```

In other words: `YIELD` with `YIELD.Options.progress == true` and `RESULT` with `RESULT.Details.progress == true` messages may only be sent *during* a call or invocation is still ongoing.

The final `YIELD` and final `RESULT` may also be empty, e.g. when all actual results have already been transmitted in progressive result messages.

*Example.* Callee-to-Dealer `YIELDs`

{align="left"}
```
    [70, 87683, {"progress": true}, ["Y2010", 120]]
    [70, 87683, {"progress": true}, ["Y2011", 205]]
     ...
    [70, 87683, {"progress": true}, ["Total", 490]]
    [70, 87683, {}]
```

*Example.* Dealer-to-Caller `RESULTs`

{align="left"}
```
    [50, 77133, {"progress": true}, ["Y2010", 120]]
    [50, 77133, {"progress": true}, ["Y2011", 205]]
     ...
    [50, 77133, {"progress": true}, ["Total", 490]]
    [50, 77133, {}]
```

The progressive `YIELD` and progressive `RESULT` may also be empty, e.g. when those messages are only used to signal that the procedure is still running and working, and the actual result is completely delivered in the final `YIELD` and `RESULT`:

*Example.* Callee-to-Dealer `YIELDs`

{align="left"}
```
    [70, 87683, {"progress": true}]
    [70, 87683, {"progress": true}]
    ...
    [70, 87683, {}, [["Y2010", 120], ["Y2011", 205], ...,
        ["Total", 490]]]
```

*Example.* Dealer-to-Caller `RESULTs`

{align="left"}
```
    [50, 77133, {"progress": true}]
    [50, 77133, {"progress": true}]
    ...
    [50, 77133, {}, [["Y2010", 120], ["Y2011", 205], ...,
        ["Total", 490]]]
```

> Note that intermediate, progressive results and/or the final result MAY have different structure. The WAMP peer implementation is responsible for mapping everything into a form suitable for consumption in the host language.

*Example.* Callee-to-Dealer `YIELDs`

{align="left"}
```
    [70, 87683, {"progress": true}, ["partial 1", 10]]
    [70, 87683, {"progress": true}, [], {"foo": 10,
        "bar": "partial 1"}]
     ...
    [70, 87683, {}, [1, 2, 3], {"moo": "hello"}]
```

*Example.* Dealer-to-Caller `RESULTs`

{align="left"}
```
    [50, 77133, {"progress": true}, ["partial 1", 10]]
    [50, 77133, {"progress": true}, [], {"foo": 10,
        "bar": "partial 1"}]
     ...
    [50, 77133, {}, [1, 2, 3], {"moo": "hello"}]
```

Even if a *Caller* has indicated its expectation to receive progressive results by setting `CALL.Options.receive_progress|bool := true`, a *Callee* is **not required** to produce progressive results. `CALL.Options.receive_progress` and `INVOCATION.Details.receive_progress` are simply indications that the *Caller* is prepared to process progressive results, should there be any produced. In other words, *Callees* are free to ignore such `receive_progress` hints at any time.

#### Progressive Call Result Cancellation

Upon receiving a `YIELD` message from a *Callee* with `YIELD.Options.progress == true` (for a call that is still ongoing), if the original *Caller* is no longer available (has left the realm), then the *Dealer* will send an `INTERRUPT` to the *Callee*.  The `INTERRUPT` will have `Options.mode` set to `"killnowait"` to indicate to the client that no response should be sent to the `INTERRUPT`. This `INTERRUPT` in only sent in response to a progressive `YIELD` (`Details.progress == true`), and is not sent in response to a normal or final `YIELD`.
```
[INTERRUPT, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict]
```
Options:
```
INTERRUPT.Options.mode|string == "killnowait"
```

Progressive call result cancellation closes an important safety gap: In cases where progressive results are used to stream data to *Callers*, and network connectivity is unreliable, *Callers* my often get disconnected in the middle of receiving progressive results. Recurring connect, call, disconnect cycles can quickly build up *Callees* streaming results to dead *Callers*. This can overload the router and further degrade network connectivity.

The message flow for progressive results cancellation involves:

     ,------.           ,------.          ,------.
     |Caller|           |Dealer|          |Callee|
     `--+---'           `--+---'          `--+---'
        |       CALL       |                 |
        | ----------------->                 |
        |                  |                 |
        |                  |    INVOCATION   |
        |                  | ---------------->
        |                  |                 |
        |                  | YIELD (progress)|
        |                  | <----------------
        |                  |                 |
        | RESULT (progress)|                 |
        | <-----------------                 |
     ,--+---.              |                 |
     |Caller|              |                 |
     `------'              | YIELD (progress)|
      (gone)               | <----------------
                           |                 |
                           |    INTERRUPT    |    
                           | ---------------->    
                           |                 |    
                        ,--+---.          ,--+---.
                        |Dealer|          |Callee|
                        `------'          `------'

Note: Any `ERROR` returned by the *Callee*, in response to the `INTERRUPT`, is ignored (same as in call canceling when mode="killnowait"). So, it is not necessary for the *Callee* to send an `ERROR` message.

#### Callee

A *Callee* that does not support progressive results SHOULD ignore any `INVOCATION.Details.receive_progress` flag.

A *Callee* that supports progressive results, but does not support call canceling is considered by the *Dealer* to not support progressive results.

#### Feature Announcement

Support for this advanced feature MUST be announced by *Callers* (`role := "caller"`), *Callees* (`role := "callee"`) and *Dealers* (`role := "dealer"`) via

{align="left"}
        HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
             progressive_call_results|bool := true

Additionally, *Callees* and *Dealers* MUST support Call Canceling, which is required for canceling progressive results if the original *Caller* leaves the realm. If a *Callee* supports Progressive Call Results, but not Call Canceling, then the *Dealer* disregards the *Callees* Progressive Call Results feature.
