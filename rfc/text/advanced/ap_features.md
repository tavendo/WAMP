## Features

Support for advanced features must be announced by the peers which implement them. The following is a complete list of advanced features currently defined or proposed.

Status | Description
-------|--------------------------------------------------
sketch | There is a rough description of an itch to scratch, but the feature use case isn't clear, and there is no protocol proposal at all.
alpha  | The feature use case is still fuzzy and/or the feature definition is unclear, but there is at least a protocol level proposal.
beta   | The feature use case is clearly defined and the feature definition in the spec is sufficient to write a prototype implementation. The feature definition and details may still be incomplete and change.
stable | The feature definition in the spec is complete and stable and the feature use case is field proven in real applications. There are multiple, interoperable implementations.
