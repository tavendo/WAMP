        This document defines the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP). WAMP is a routed protocol that provides two
        messaging patterns: Publish & Subscribe and routed Remote Procedure Calls. It is intended to connect application
        components in distributed applications. WAMP uses WebSocket as its default transport, but can be transmitted via
        any other protocol that allows for ordered, reliable, bi-directional, and message-oriented communications.
