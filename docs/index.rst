Welcome to the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)!

WAMP is an open standard `WebSocket <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455>`_
`subprotocol <https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml>`_ that provides two
application messaging patterns in one unified protocol:

* routed **Remote Procedure Calls** and
* **Publish & Subscribe**

The WAMP protocol is a community effort and the specification is made available for
free under an open license for everyone to use or implement. The original design
and proposal was created by `Crossbar.io <https://crossbar.io>`_ developers in 2012 and
WAMP development is sponsored since then by `Crossbar.io (the company) <https://crossbario.com>`_.
